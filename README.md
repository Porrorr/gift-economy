# Gift Economy

Gift Economy is a service which enables people to give things away for free including the sort of community rating and moderation which makes peer-to-peer interactions easier to trust.

Currently it's very much a work in progress. The UI especially is incredibly ugly.

## Quick Start

You'll need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) running. Then it's just a matter of
```
npm install
npm start
```
